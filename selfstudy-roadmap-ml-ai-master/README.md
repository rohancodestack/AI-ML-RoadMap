## What’s in this repo

Here, you'll find an evolving collection of resources aimed to lay down the core principles of Machine Learning for you, regardless of whether you're looking to make a career leap or just fuel a personal passion. The goal? Simply to kickstart your journey. While I've mapped out a pathway here, yours could be entirely different. Think of this repo as your personal learning buffet — sample what resonates with your palate.

Though I've packed in a lot, this isn't an exhaustive trove. Every learner carves out a unique trail, and with that in mind, I've made this a collaborative space. I eagerly await input from both seasoned ML veterans and those just dipping their toes. Let's co-create a richer repository!



## Machine Learning or AI? Let's Break it Down

Before diving deep, it's essential to understand the fundamental difference between Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Here's a straightforward breakdown inspired by [this source](https://youtu.be/4RixMPF4xis?si=GQ7UPO29bcEdsTs0):

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Think of AI as the broader goal of autonomous machine intelligence. It's about crafting systems that can perform tasks requiring human-like intellect - tasks such as discovery, inference, and reasoning.

*Key Domains in AI*:

- **Natural Language Processing**: Understanding and generating human language.
- **Computer Vision**: Making sense of visual data.
- **Text to Speech**: Converting written text into spoken words.
- **Motion/Robotics**: Making machines move or perform tasks.
- **Generative AI**: Systems that can create content.
- + many more

**Machine Learning (ML)**: ML is a subset of AI. It's about giving machines access to data and letting them learn and make decisions on their own. No manual coding of rules; the machine learns from the data.

*Main Types of ML*:

- **Supervised Machine Learning**: Think of this as a "guided learning". The machine learns from labeled data, with some human oversight.
- **Unsupervised Machine Learning**: Here, the machine dives into data on its own, finding patterns and insights without being explicitly directed.
- **Deep Learning**: This goes deeper (pun intended) into machines mimicking the human brain. The "depth" here refers to the multi-layered neural networks behind these systems.
